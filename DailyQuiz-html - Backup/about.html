        Dailyquiz.click is a website that has the user do daily questions and try to keep their streak 
        going by doing the daily quizzes consistently and by not failing to answer the question correctly 
        each day. This website is designed to challenge your general knowledge on any and all subjects by 
        being asking a question about a random topic each day. The website is also a form of education 
        that has the user either do their own research to answer the question, or find out new information 
        by seeing which is the correct answer for the question of that specific day. By using a daily 
        streak format. The website also motivates users to try and keep their streak alive while also 
        competing with their friends, further motivating all users to continue educating themselves.
