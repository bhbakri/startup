### Elevator pitch

This website is designed to challenge your general knowledge on any and all subjects by being asking a question about a random topic each day. The website is also a form of education that has the user either do their own research to answer the question, or find out new information by seeing which is the correct answer for the question of that specific day. By using a daily streak format. The website also motivates users to try and keep their streak alive while also competing with their friends, further motivating all users to continue educating themselves.
